# Django Boilerplate

This project contains a django app with boilerplate code, that could be used in real world application.

The goal is, that anyone could grab a feature like logging, rest framework, settings management, etc. and paste it into their project.

The **inspiration** for this project is the Python Zen Code: 
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

I have seen multiple ways of doing something in django and to have a starter code that is usable in production is always nice :wink:
